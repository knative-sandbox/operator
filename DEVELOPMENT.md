Most users are expected to use a released version of the operator, but if you're
testing or want to use a pre-released version of of the release yamls, you may
want to build your own copy of the operator.

## Installing from source

You can install the Knative Operator from the source code using the
[ko](https://github.com/google/ko) build tool.

1. Download the source code:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/knative/operator.git
   ```

1. Install the Operator in the root directory of the source:

   ```
   ko apply -f config/
   ```

## Release yamls

The operator bundles the last N=4 releases of Knative components in
`/cmd/operator/kodata/` in various subdirectories. A few notes:

- The `kodata` files can be automatically regenerated by running
  `./hack/update-codegen.sh` or the `cmd/fetcher` command; it has a
  configuration for fetching updates in its own `kodata` directory.

- If you only want to update the yaml files, you can also mount a volume over
  `/var/run/kodata` (or set `$KO_DATA_PATH`) on the operator to pick up
  different yaml files. You can combine this with a `ReadWriteMany` volume (or a
  sidecar) to be able to update the yaml files live on-cluster without
  rebuilding the operator image.
